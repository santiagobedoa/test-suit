# Hello devs ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to Test-Suite
This repository is a collaborative work that aims to create a series of cases to test the operation and output of our code. The cases are meant to help us find bugs and make sure that our code works correctly.

If you make a contribution do not forget to leave your information in the AUTHORS file (please keep the format and do not add more information that what is required).

# How to contribute
* **clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/santiagobedoa/test-suite.git
```

* **All test must be named as follows:**
> test_authorname.sh

If you are going to upload more than one test you can number it like this:

> test_authorname_1.sh

* **Since this are bash scripts, all tests must be started by the line:**
```
#!/bin/bash
```

* **Remember to give permisions to your script, we suggest the next line:**
```
chmod u+x test_authorname.sh
```

# IMPORTANT
* Before making a contribution do not forget to do ```git pull``` but when ```git push``` only add the file you have created
* All tests must be in *test_simple_shell directory*
* You are only allowed to upload and modify your own files (*test_authorname.sh*), please do not modify other people's files or anything else. This is in order to avoid conflicts.

***If you have any comment or advice, feel free to reach me out.***
